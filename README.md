***Day 4***: You are given an array of intervals- that is, an array of tuples(start,end).
The array may not be sorted, and could contain overlapping intervals. Return another array where the overlapping intervals are merged.
Input:[(1.3),(5,8),(4,10),(20,25)]
Output:[(1,3),(4,10),(20,25)]

***Day 19***: MS Excel column titles have the following pattern: A,B,C,....Z,AA,AB,AC,.....AZ,BA,BB,BC......BZ...etc. In other words, column 1 is named as 'A', column 2 is 'B', column 26 is 'Z',column 27 is 'AA' and so forth. Given a positive integer, find its corresponding column name
Input : 26
Output : Z
Input : 51
Output : AY
Input : 676 
Output : YZ
Input : 704
Output : AAB

***Day 17***: Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
If the target is not found in the array, return 
[-1,-1]
Input: [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output : [3,4]
Input : [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output :[-1,-1]
