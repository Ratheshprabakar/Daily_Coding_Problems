***Day 1***: Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements
Input :[0,1,0,3,12]
Output : [1,3,12,0,0]

***Day 2***: You are given an array of integers. Return the largest product that can be made by multiplying any 3 integers in the array
Input : [-4,-4,2,8]
Output : 128

***Day 4***: You are given an array of intervals- that is, an array of tuples(start,end).
The array may not be sorted, and could contain overlapping intervals. Return another array where the overlapping intervals are merged.
Input:[(1.3),(5,8),(4,10),(20,25)]
Output:[(1,3),(4,10),(20,25)]

***Day 17***: Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
If the target is not found in the array, return 
[-1,-1]
Input: [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output : [3,4]
Input : [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output :[-1,-1]

***Day 19***: MS Excel column titles have the following pattern: A,B,C,....Z,AA,AB,AC,.....AZ,BA,BB,BC......BZ...etc. In other words, column 1 is named as 'A', column 2 is 'B', column 26 is 'Z',column 27 is 'AA' and so forth. Given a positive integer, find its corresponding column name
Input : 26
Output : Z
Input : 51
Output : AY
Input : 676 
Output : YZ
Input : 704
Output : AAB

***Day 25***: You are given an array representing the heights of neighboring buildings on a city street, from east to west. The city assessor would like you to write an algorithm that returns how many of these buildings have a view of the setting sun, in order to properly value the street.

For example, given the array [3,7,8,3,6,1], you should return 3, since the top floors of the  buildings with heights 8,6 and 1 all have an unobstructed view to the west.

Can you do this using just one forward pass through the array?
